Session Initialization: The code starts a session to store the userâ€™s 2FA code securely.
Custom 2FA Authentication: When a user logs in, the system checks if the user is a "customer" and triggers a 2FA verification by sending a code to their email.
2FA Verification: https://example.com/2fa-verification/ A page with the shortcode [two_factor_auth_form] is used to input the 2FA code. The system verifies the code and logs the user in if it's correct.
Redirection: On login failure, users are redirected to the login page with an error message.
Clear Session on Logout: The 2FA code is cleared when the user logs out.
Modify the Redirection URLs:
Update the redirect URLs as needed in the code:
Login Redirect: Change wp_redirect(home_url('/my-account/')); to the desired redirect page after successful login.
Failed Login Redirect: Customize the URL for login errors, usually at wp-login.php.
